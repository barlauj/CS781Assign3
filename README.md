# BU_CS781 Big Data Assignment 

A repository for an assignment as part of Boston University's CS 781 (Advanced Health Informatics) for analyzing clinical documents using an open-source parser. 

Note the BlueButtonJS parser (https://www.npmjs.com/package/blue-button) is recommended for the assignment, although other parsers (or languages!) are welcome. 

Samples in this resporitory are completely fictional and any resemblence to a real patient is coincidental. We've brought over a subset of samples from a public repostiory (https://github.com/chb/sample_ccdas). We didn't create them, so don't contact us regarding. Use them at your risk and we provide no guarantee or warranty that they are good for anything! 

Note that this isn't really "big data" but if you can do it programmatically for 100 patients, you're on your way to big data :)
